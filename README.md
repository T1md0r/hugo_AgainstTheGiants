# from scratch clone and run

```
git clone --recurse-submodules git@github.com:dunhampa/hugo_sandboxThemePapaya.git hugo_destTest  
```
Believe this would have worked for already cloned:

```
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

# sandbox_hugoThemePapaya

Clone and run
```
hugo server -D
```

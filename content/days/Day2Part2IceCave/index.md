The frost giant wasn’t there to talk and Silvius found him stunning. His look in this battle would be brought to perfection if he was covered in glistening snow so Silvius made it snow on the battlefield.

Oscorn, Erik, Kazzug bravely ran to face the frost giant while all drawing their weapons.  Fennuris and Kalinar attacked with bow and blast. ADC built another wall of ice blocking the frost giant's path as another frost giant appeared from around the corner.

Silvius ran back to fetch his illusion and cover tracks. As he ran back down the cave, he nearly bumped straight into a stone giant and a pack of ogres. He concealed the path to his friends with his avalanche illusion and prayed for Ilmater’s protection while the giant smashed down powerful blows. Silvius ran to the north to pull them away from his friends.  Until he came upon a frost giant blocking his path and was pinned in the cave between giants of stone and frost. He tried to teleport but crashed back to where he started awaiting the giant's blows.

The rest of the party attacked the frost giant when they noticed a familiar mist. The cloud giant from Nosnra’s stronghold appeared. Just then, the ogres made it past the illusion and attacked from the north while the frost giants and cloud giant continued attacking from the south. The team split fighting enemies from both the north and south. Oscorn hurled the javelin of lightning down the line of ogres and dropped his hammer in the hall. He then ran back and forth across the party with inspiring yells of “why aren’t people doing more!” and "Has anyone seen my hammer?!". ADC summoned a beholderkin from his distant lands that immediately started raining down blasts on the giants and ogres. Kalinar used his signature eldritch blast fog cloud to obscure the north and blasted any Ogre that stepped through the fog. Czolg became a raging giant himself, blocking the path from the south and killing frost giants and ogres with his mighty spear Panzerfaust. Terrified of Czolg, the Cloud Giant ran away in fear again and again ending with him fleeing to the southeast  with a brown stain running down his backside. ADC seeing the power of fear, summoned the ghost of one of his most fearsome fallen fighters. The ghost fought and terrified the giant back into the corner of the cave until the frost giant fell. Meanwhile Silvius appeared around the corner running for his life with fast dancing steps as the stone and frost giant chased him. 

The cloud giant began fighting with magic along with his might. First attempting to grab and throw Kalinar with his mind. However, Kalinar’s patron would not allow it. The cloud giant then tried the same to Erik, killing him with a slam against the wall. However the sting of Panzerfaust was relentless.  Realizing he was truly doomed, the cloud giant ran back to the south west where he came and obscured his path with another misty fog. Silvius healed Erik then pursued the cloud giant. He stopped at the edge of the south west tunnel and kept watch while the others attacked the giants to the north. He noticed a ledge with a box on the south east corner and skillfully climbed the wall and found a box of treasure including:
- 5 gems worth 100gp each which he later gave to Oscorn
- 2 golden sashes with the symbol of a bear. He wore one and presented the other to ADC
- Another sash was found on a frost giant and given to Czolg
- 1,600 gold pieces were found (1,400 in Kalinars bag and 200 in Oscorn's)d in giant bags at the base of the ledge (Kalinar put 1,400 in his bag and Oscorn added 200 to his)

The fight in the northern tunnel turned in the party’s favor as Czolg approached and Kalinar hit the ogres with particularly powerful blasts of magic. The ogres stopped their charge fearing certain death. Oscorn then retrieved his javelin of lighting and hammer.

Sticking with his motto “you have to go in to get out”, Czolg entered the fog feeling along the walls. Unsure of where the cloud giant went he returned. Silvius then took out his lantern of revealing, tied a rope around his waist, and handed the other end of the rope to his friends as he entered the fog. Keeping to the wall on his left he slowly crept through the fog down a long passage until the fog cleared. He returned to bring his companions and they all entered a deep cave. This appeared to be the home of the Jarl with an impressive entrance covered with large images of giants, monsters, and battles carved into the walls. However, the place was eerily quiet.

The party sneaked down the hallway and noticed boulders blocking doors to the west and east. The group decided to check the eastern boulder first. Czolg, Silvius, Erik, and Kazzug moved the boulder while the rest prepared to blast anything that came out only to find more silence. The team entered the passageway until it opened up to another massive cave. The snow and ice glistened along with treasure and weapons shining in the snow. 

Everyone cautiously explored the cave and Czolg closed the boulder door behind them. Kalinar walked up massive stairs to a high ledge until a white dragon emerged from the snow. It attacked with fangs and claws, but missed Kalinar, a miraculous feat no living being has witnessed before. Then a second white dragon appeared in the middle of the cave. Silvius trapped the white dragon on the ledge in a wall of force bubble to spare Kalinar and fight the dragons one at a time. 

The party is now locked in battle with a white dragon while the dragon’s boyfriend watches. Will the party defeat the dragon couple or escape? Or will the dragons add to their hoard? Is this truly the home of the Jarl and will they find him? We may find out tonight!

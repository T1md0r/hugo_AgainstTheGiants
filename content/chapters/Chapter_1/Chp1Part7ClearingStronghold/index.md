The noises of the fight were replaced with the moans of the injured and frightened chatter across the commoner Orcs. Silvius walked up to Grimfang and said "We have much to discuss, but our team needs rest."
Grimfang replied between orders to his Orcs "You and yours can take a break. We will gladley handle what's left of any of these giants and bugbears. Go ahead and take the sleeping room at the end of the hall." as he pointed down the hallway past the kitchen.

The team was curious as to if any of the items they picked up were magic. Silvius called upon Ilmaters guidence to see the glows of any magic near him. None of what he had found had a glimpse of magic. However, as he walked to the other side of the room, he sensed a glow on the torch haning on the wall.

Silvius cautiosly approached torch and slightly tapped it with his spectral hand. As the hand made contact, reality would slightly bend out of the illusion showing the bottom of a sword scabbard. His magic hand wasn't strong enough to free the illusory torch. Silvius approached and as he lifted the torch he realized it was a stunning greatsword and could feel it's power beyond the magical glow.

"ADC what do you think of this?" Silvius called out as he approached the wizard preparing to rest. ADC at first was slightly annoyed from being disturbed from his preparations for the night. His eyes widened and seemed to glow as he realized what Silvius had found. "You say it's magic, Silvius?" ADC questioned as he studied the details of the sword's double cross-guard and it's long detailed etched blade, "Give me some time with it." ADC spent some time studying the blade while everyone prepared to rest and then told us of the swords power.

"This is Waythe. I introduce him since he is intelligent. Well, not ADC intelligent of course. However, he can think and communicate to the level of most of those here. He loves to strike down giants in the name of good. As in he will quite literally knock them to the ground... This is a special find for us and should be used by our most powerful warrior."

All eyes turned to Czolg as he tucked in Panzerfaust for the night then he turned to the party with a confused "What?" ADC walking over to Czolg told him "I present to you Waythe, the legendary giant slaying weapon." 

Czolg picked up Waythe and gave some skilled and mighty practice swings then set it back down. "Too short and does not stab" he said as he tossed it down. 

Silvius picked up Waythe and handed it back to him saying "Czolg, this is a legendary giant dropping sword for our legendary giant dropping barbarian. You have to at least try it out." Czolg staring back longingly and regretfully at Panzerfaust agreed to give Wayth a try.

It was now late and the entire team decided to rest. Silvius let Grimfang and Rock know they were free to wake the team if they encountered something they couldn't handle, all but guaranteeing a full night's rest.


In the morning the entire party was feeling wonderful after a long rest. They were all excited to see what else was to be found in the giant stronghold now that they could move freely without the giants. As they opened the door they were caught up in the flow of Orcs hurridly walking around in every direction carrying supplies found throughout the ground floor. 

Walking north up the hallway the team decided to do some searching. Oscorn and Silvius both prayed to their gods to detect the presense of any magic as the team walked through the other bedrooms. In one of the bedrooms they noticed a glow from inside one of the chests. Silvius popped the lid open and amongst the old clothes he found two vials. "Czolg catch!" as Silvius tossed the potion to Czolg he said "it'll make you strong as a storm giant." "Kalinar!" as Silvius passed the second potion he told him "invisibility, you might get hit less if nobody can see you" 

As they left the bedroom Grimfang approached. "We have an issue we should discuss. We know how we would handle it," as he taps his bugbear mace, "but we thought you may have an opinion. Follow me." Silvius put his hand on Oscorn's shoulder and said "Oscorn and I are kind of in the finding treasure zone right now. How about Oscorn and I do a quick lap while we've got this vibe and meet you back at our room?" Everyone agreed and Fennuris, Kalinar, and Czolg followed Grimfang. 

"Oscorn! We're going downstairs" Silvius excitedly said to Oscorn. 
Oscorn looked at Silvis confused "There is at least one Fire Giant down there. Why would only the two of us go?"
"Not that part of the basement. The one where I found this and this" Silvius said as he tapped his sword then showed him the map signed Ecvaldra. "There were manticores down there. They were not standing in the way of this stuff, but probably something else."
"Plus, now the manticores are all dead" Oscorn as he started to get excited.
"There must be something good. And it will be fun!"

Oscorn and Silvius agreed and Silvius led them to the secret door from Nosnra's planning room. As they walked Silvius told the tales of Kalinar and him the last time they were here. Oscorn grew more excited as they continued to walk down the stairs. Silvius then took him to the side only Kalinar had seen. Oscorn and Silvius checked out the fake treasure then noticed the doors further to the south. Walking inside the found several chests. Oscorn could feel the glow of magic inside one of the chests. Silvius started opening chest with his magic hand. Most of them popped right open but two appeared locked. Silvius got out his thieves tools and opened the first locked chest. He then opened the second locked chest. As he clicked the lock open, he heard an unusual click. An arrow shot out of the wall and hit him in the shoulder. Silvius could feel the sting of poison and tried to fight it off but it was too strong. Silvius could feel his mind dull and his body tire. 


Held a meeting with the orc leaders and other key prisoners
Agreed the orcs would go home after preparations 
We would send help to meet them on the journey? 
Searched the lower level
Oscorn attacked with Waythe. Waythe was delighted while Oscorn rolled around on the ground
Czolg took the sword from the fire giants hand
Killed the fire giant 
Found wine in the fire giants bag
Kalinar proposed a toast
We all drank
Silvius and Kalinar partied hard
Searched the lower level finding some more treasure and barrels of wine
At the wine storage room, Silvius filled up a water skin and Kalinar desperately tried to get one more drink
Found a spring of fresh water
Kalinar dove straight in
Found what looked like a passage and swam through 
Silvius grabbed a potion of water breathing took off his armor and dove in
Kalinar and Silvius swam down the tunnel as it opened up to a cave
Bit of ancient bones, armor, weapons, and treasure littered the ground
Suddenly a monster appeared from a deep hole in the ground
Kalinar ran back to the party at an incredible speed
Silvius knew he was outmatched and couldn’t escape as another beast came out through a hole further to the north 
Prayed to Ilmater for protection
Powerful spirits surrounded Silvius.
Killing the first monster before it could strike
The one from the north charged Silvius
It pushed past the spirits and got in Silvius face 
Silvius drew and activated his sword of flames, stabbing the beast in the head pithing him with fire 
Silvia’s called back to Kalinar the danger had past
Kalinar and Silvius gathered the treasure and returned to their friends
We agreed to bring an empty barrel with us and use the chain to travel to the Black Ice
